So for this project I have to measure a sample of calcite granulas.
The for the recording of the sample we use a flatbed scanner with a glossy black background.
The glossy black background is used because the calcite granulas are whiteish and the black adds contrast.

This is gonna be part of a simple program that let's the user add a sample on top and hit the scan button, the user is able to do some simple interactions with the software if needed like clicking on the background.
After the software found the particles it will spit out a list of static diameters (contour and area of the particles to calculate the diameter of a perfect circle)

After which the software spits out a histogram of the sample defining the amount of particles with roughly the same diameter in mm.

The scanner scans at 1200 dpi and is a standard flatbed a4 scanner (this is used as the known size)

the sample can range between a diameter of 0.2-2 mm and the particles could sometimes touch.  

background can be swapped for a better color if the sample has a differt color (black particles and a white background).
However this is optional for the moment main focus is for the ganulas with the black background.


because I am at home I had to create new pictures so I used white chocolate orb, sesam seeds and paper circles.
a smaller granula is possible but I couldn't find one atm.

Real samples are:

Problems at the moment:

It seems like my way to define the foreground doesnt work if you have larger and smaller particles this is the main problem at the moment.

some pictures to show the problem.

what has to happen.
so the challange at the moment on the physical part is to create an as even as possible black background, which seems to work with glossy paper, and to get the multiple sizes working.
